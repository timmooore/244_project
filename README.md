This goal of this project was to implement an application of graph using several C++ principles including inheritance, polymorphism, and operator overloading. We chose to make a rudimentary model of flight paths where each node is a city and each weighted edge denotes a flight between the two cities, where the weight of the edge is the approximate miles of the flight.

There are two implementations, one where the graphs are directed and another where they are undirected. In both cases, the most interesting features are the pathfinding algorithms, which use depth-first search and recursion to find all possible paths from a given city and the total miles of the path/
